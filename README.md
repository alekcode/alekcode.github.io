1. What is the URL to your GitHub-pages site?
  https://alekcode.github.io/

2. What API did you use and why?
  I used the iTunes Search API because it is very well documented. Also, I like movies, so I chose
  an API related to movies.

3. What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe how
an app using it for that purpose might work.
  This API could be used to collect information about many different types of media on the iTunes
  store. For example, someone could create an app that collects all songs by a specific artist or
  all TV shows with a specific rating.

4. Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive & mobile-friendly.
  I tried to use flexboxes where I could so that the webpage would properly adjust its elements
  based on the size of the browser window.

5. How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or
colorblindness?
  Adding a high contrast mode with larger font sizes could help with accessbility to people
  who are blind/colorblind.

6. If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what would
they be and how would you go about implementing them?
  I would make this web page into a React app because that is what the project specifies. However,
  I currently don't have any experience with any JavaScript frameworks.
  Besides making this a React app, I would add the ability to search for different kinds of media
  (TV shows, podcasts, songs). This would require me to add an element like a dropdown menu that
  would allow the user to pick which category of media they want to search for.
